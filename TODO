Model datasets and preprocessing as in Pylearn2.

Allow for caching (saving to disk) of proprocessed datasets, 
for later loading (later use). 

Dont eliminate the TableDataset idea, its a good one. It indexes 
all elements of a data table to a table of batches of elements, where 
each batch of element is a tensor.

Find a way to implement multinomial sampling, where each example 
has a probability of being sampled, and where this probability 
is somewhat proportional to the cost (error) of the example. This 
would require linking the training criteria to the dataset.
